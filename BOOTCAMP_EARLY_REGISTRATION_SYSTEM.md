# Bootcamp Early Registration System

## Overview

A comprehensive system for managing early registrations for the **April 15, 2026 Bootcamp** with three key scenarios:

1. **Express Interest (Free)** - Collect user information and demographics
2. **Pay $100 Holding Fee** - Secure spot + lock in $1,500 early-bird discount
3. **Admin Dashboard** - View registrations, track contacts, manage "closers" workflow

---

## üéØ Primary Goal

**Attract users to the site and learn who they are** (demographics, phone conversation opportunities) to understand our audience and convert them into paid bootcamp students.

- **Quality over quantity**: Better to have 10 highly motivated students than 30 unqualified leads
- **Track everything**: Every contact attempt, every conversation, every objection
- **Iterate quickly**: Test messaging, pricing, timing - find what works
- **Build relationships**: This is a high-ticket sale, relationships matter
